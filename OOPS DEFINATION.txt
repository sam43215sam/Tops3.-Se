 What is OOP? List OOP concepts

ANS- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes
 software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.
 An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

 What is the difference between OOP and POP?

ANS- The main difference between OOP and POP is that OOP divides the program into multiple 
objects to solve the problem while POP divides the program into multiple procedures or functions
 to solve the problem.

~In OOP, data is treated as a critical element in the program and is encapsulated within objects.
 The objects are instances of classes that have attributes and methods. The attributes are variables
 that store data while methods are functions that operate on that data.

~In POP, data is not encapsulated within objects but is passed between functions as parameters.
 Functions are used to manipulate data and perform operations on it.
